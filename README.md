# foto-winkel
A small simple image editor written in Rust using the Bevy game-engine. I made this mainly to learn the tools, and possibly in the future, to implement personal image editing effects on.

## Features
* Opening and saving of png and jpeg images
* Dragging & zooming
* Pencil tool
* Rainbow pencil (awesome)
* Pixel sorting

## Todo
* Undo and redo

## Building
Like most other Rust crates, simply `cargo run`. The libraries used should be cross-platform.
